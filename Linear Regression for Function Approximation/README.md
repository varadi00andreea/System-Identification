        Assignment description
        
Perform a function approximation with linear regression and polynomial approximators.

A data set of input-output pairs is given, where the outputs are generated by an unknown function g. The function has one input variable and one output variable, and the output measurements are affected by noise. Develop an approximator of this function, using linear model with polynomial terms. The parameters of the model will be found using the identification data set. A second data set is provided for validationg the developed model. The two data sets are located in the "lab4_11" file.

Requirements: 
  Plot the identification data to get an idea of the function shape.
  Create a polynomial approximator of degree n-1, where n is the number of parameters/ basis functions; n should be tunnable.
  For any value of n, create a system of linear equations for linear regression, using the identification data.
  Validate the model on the different validation data set: compute the apptoximated outputs and from those the MSE on the validation data. Show a plot of the approximated function on the validation dara set, comparing to the actual outputs.
