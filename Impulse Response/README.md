        Transient Analysis of Impulse Responses
        

"lab3_order1_7" contains several impulse signals and the response of a first-order system, and the "lab3_order2_7" file contains similar data for a second-order system. Each experimet begins with 30 initial steps where the system is in its initial, steady-state condition, after wich three consecutive impulse-response experiment are performed, each corresponding to 100 time steps. The initial conditions are nonzero.

For both systems (first & second order), I have developed a transfer function model of the system, using the first impulse signal and response from the data, after wich I have validated the model using the data for the second and third impulse responses (this is the validation data) and simulated it from the correct non-zero initial condition.
