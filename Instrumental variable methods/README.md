    Assignment description
    
The data is provided in the "lab9_2" file. The file contains the identification data in variable 'id', and separately the validation data in variable 'val'. The system is of the order given in variable 'n' in the data file; and the disturbance is not white noise, but colored. Thus, for all model we will use na=nb=n.

The task is to implement the IV algorithm using instruments based on ARX outputs.

Requirements:

  Identify an ARX model with orders chosen as above and inspect its quality.
  
  Identify the models with IV method, one with the ARX variables and one with simple variables.
  
  Compare the quality of the models.
