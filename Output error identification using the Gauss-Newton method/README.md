    Assignment description
    
The datafile "lab8_2" contains the identification data in a variable 'id', and separately the validation data in a variable 'val'.

Requirements:

  Implement the algorithm and run it on the identification data starting from nonzero parameters.
  
  For the near-optimal values of 'f' and 'b' obtained, create an OE model int the system identification toolbox format, using 'idpoly'
  
  If the model is not satisfactory, tune the parameters to improve performance.
