        Assignment description
        

We apply the linear regression method to obtain finite impulse response (FIR) models from input-output data. This data is more general than just the step or impulse responses we have been seeing so far.

Requirements: 

   Plot and examine the data suplied in the "lab5_5" file
   
   After making sure the signals are zero-mean, compute the correlation functions from the identification data.
   
   Implement the system of linear equations to obtain the FIR model for an arbitrary value of M supported by the data.
   
   Compute the convolutions to simulate the model response to the identification and validation inputs and compare with the identification and validation outputs.
   
   Study the influence of the length M of the FIR model on the accuracy of the model.
